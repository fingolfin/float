                             The Float package

This is the README file for the GAP package "Float",
version $Id$

This package implements floating-point numbers, with arbitrary precision,
based on the C libraries MPFR, MPFI, MPC and CXSC.

The package is distributed in source form, and does not require anything
else than a running GAP 4.5 or later. For updates, check

     http://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/laurent/Float/
  
To use the package, your must first compile it; this is done by invoking
`./configure' and then `make' in the main directory (where this file is).
`./configure' may be invoked with an argument GAPDIR=xxx to specify the
location of the main GAP directory (by default ../.., i.e. assuming that
this package is in pkg/float under the main GAP directory).

This package requires external libraries, at least one of mpfr, mpfi, mpc or
cxsc. If they are already on your system, you may enable them with the
switches `--with-mpfr=xxx', `--with-mpfi=xxx', `--with-mpc=xxx' and
`--with-cxsc=xxx', specifying at which prefix they are installed (if xxx is
absent, the default prefixes will be searched). If you do not wish to
install them, you may disable their inclusion using `--without-cxsc' etc.

If you wish to fully install the package but your system does not include
these libraries, download the following files, and put them
in the directory extern/; then execute `./configure && make':
- http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-3.1.0.tar.bz2
- https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/27345/mpfi-1.5.tar.bz2
- http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/download/mpc-0.9.tar.gz
- http://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~xsc/xsc/cxsc/cxsc-2-5-1.tar.gz
- http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/xavier.pujol/fplll/libfplll-3.1.3.tar.gz

Once the package has been compiled, it may be used within GAP by typing

LoadPackage("Float");

The "Float" package banner should appear on the screen.
New floating-point handlers may be then set by typing

SetFloats(MPFR,1000);

to have 1000-bits floating-point numbers. For details on how to use the Float
package, please consult the documentation. It is in the `doc' subdirectory
(view `manual.pdf' with a PDF viewer, or `index.html' with a browser).
